VALUES ('Alewife.png', 'Alewife', 'Shad, Herring, Gaspereau, Klack, Kyack, Branch Herring, Fresh Water Herring, Grayback', 'Yes', 'The alewife is a species of Herring. They exist as both anadromous and landlocked forms. The front of the body is deep and larger than other fish found in the same waters, and its common name is thought to have been derived from a corpulent female tavern keeper ("ale-wife"). The alewife has also been thought to be referenced as being "the wives of the eels" that come up the rivers at the same time as the alewife.

The alewife, like the sea herring, is grayish green above, darkest on the back, paler and silvery on sides and belly. Usually there is a dusky spot on either side just behind the margin of the gill cover (lacking in the herring) and the upper side may be faintly striped with dark longitudinal lines in large fish. The sides are iridescent in life, with shades of green and violet. The colors change, to some extent, in shade from darker to paler, or vice versa, to match the bottom below, as the fish run up stream in shallow water.

Alewives are decidedly general in their choice of streams, running indifferently up rivers as large as the Mississippi or streams so small and shallow that one can almost leap across it. The alewife grows to a length of about 15 inches, but adults average only about 10 to 11 inches long and about 8 to 9 ounces in weight.', 'Clupeidae', 'Alosa pseudoharengus', 'Least Concern', 'The alewife is a schooling species. Within habitat types, they tend to select cooler water temperatures. 

Juveniles remain in fresh water for the first six to eight months of their lives (unless landlocked in which case they spend their entire life in fresh water), feeding on small fishes and invertebrates.', 'Primarily classified as a baitfish most shad and herring are typically caught by dip netting (scooping the fish out of shallow constricted areas during its migratory patterns up streams and rivers), cast netting, vertical dropping or cast snagging with a heftily weighted treble hook and occasionally by using a small lure or small hook rigged with cut bait.', 'The anadromous alewife, like the shad and salmon undergoes most of its growth in the sea, but enters fresh water streams to spawn. Numbers of them are often seen in streams during spring alternately swimming ahead; resting in the eddy or behind some irregularity of the bottom; then moving ahead again. 

During the early runs sometimes one sex predominates, sometimes the other, but the late runs consist chiefly of males, as a rule, and these are said to outnumber the females greatly on the spawning grounds.

The alewife spawns in ponds, including those back of barrier beaches (if there are openings to the sea, natural or artificial) and in sluggish stretches of streams, never in swift water.

Each female deposits from 60,000 to 100,000 eggs or more, according to her size. Spawning lasts only a few days for each group of fish.

The spent fish run down stream again so soon after spawning that many of them pass others coming up, as can often be seen in the wild. Fish on their return journey to salt water are familiar sights in just about very alewife stream.

Spawning ordinarily takes place at temperatures of about 55° to 60° F. The eggs are pink like those of the sea herring and stick to brush, stones, or anything else they may make contact with or settle upon. Incubation typically takes about 6 days in 60° F water. The young alewives are about 5 mm long when hatched. They measure about 15 mm at around a month old when some begin to work their way downstream. Successive companies of fry move out of the ponds and downstream with the current throughout the summer. By autumn the young alewives have grown to about 2 to 4 inches long and have found their way down to salt water.

1. Commercial and Bait Use: While not typically targeted by sport anglers, Alewife are often used as bait for larger game fish due to their availability and abundance.

2. Forage Fish Role: They serve as an important forage fish in many aquatic ecosystems, providing a crucial food source for larger predatory fish, such as bass and trout.

3. Migration Patterns: Alewife are known for their migratory behavior, particularly in the context of spawning runs, where they move from saltwater to freshwater to reproduce, similar to salmon.

4. Ecological Impact: In some areas, Alewife have been introduced to freshwater systems where they have had significant ecological impacts, influencing food webs and competing with native species.

5. Environmental Indicator: Their presence and abundance can serve as an indicator of environmental health and the state of the aquatic ecosystem.

These characteristics make the Alewife an ecologically significant species, even if they are not a primary target for recreational fishing.

It can be distinguished from the striped bass by broken rather than solid horizontal stripes on the body. Hybrids are considered better suited for culture in ponds than either parent species because they are more resilient to extremes of temperature and to low dissolved oxygen.', 'Moronidae', 'Morone saxatilis x Morone chrysops', 'Least Concern', 'Hybrid striped bass usually occupy open water and are stocked in many lakes and reservoirs within the United States. They are more tolerant to warm water than are striped bass and grow very rapidly.', 'Hybrid striped bass fishing tackle often consists of the same heavy baitcasting, spincasting or spinning outfits with a good backbone and 15 to 25 pound test line similar to the gear used for traditional striped bass fishing.

Live bait is a preferred choice for hybrid angling and includes large minnows, gizzard shad and threadfin shad. Anglers typically hook the live bait and let it swim to entice a bite. Many leave the bail open and wait for the line to start darting after the fish has consumed the bait. After the fish has run for a bit the bail is flipped, the hook set and the angler hunkers down for one heck of a battle!

As far as artificial lures are concerned, large feathered or plastic jig combinations, spoons, crankbaits (that imitate shad or other fish) and bucktails are all deemed excellent choices for catching hybrid striped bass. Trolling, drift fishing, jump fishing and deep jigging are the top fishing methods for catching hybrid striped bass with lures.

When fishing with lures, many anglers watch for flocks of birds diving into the water as these birds are typically following schools of hybrids and stripers who are chasing baitfish to the surface. Once the flocks have been spotted the angler moves his boat close enough to cast into the frenzy in order to get in on a piece of the action. Several fish can be caught in a row when fishing this method however the fish can also disappear just as fast as they appear sometimes. Many anglers begin vertically jigging with heavy spoons or jigs once the school has submerged.

', 'The hybrid striped bass does not occur naturally. Like many hybrids, they experience great difficulty reproducing naturally. Eggs and sperm produced by hybrids are usually weak or improperly formed. The same is true of any fry that might be produced by chance fertilization. For this reason, hybrids are considered “functionally sterile.”  

Hybrid striped bass populations are completely dependent on the stocking of each state’s Division of Wildlife on an annual basis to maintain sport fisheries.

Largemouth Bass are so adaptable to different environments that they are the most available species for anglers in the United States. 

Because they feed on such a large variety of prey, largemouths will chase a wide variety of artificial lures and unlike many trout species and game fish, lures do not necessarily need to imitate specific prey of largemouth bass. Consequently, there is probably no other freshwater game fish for which there is such a wide range of lure types, sizes, colors, and actions.

Here are some effective techniques for targeting Largemouth Bass:
 Topwater Fishing: Topwater lures such as buzzbaits, poppers, frogs, and prop baits can be very effective for targeting Largemouth Bass, especially during low light conditions or when Bass are actively feeding near the surface. 
Work these lures over and around cover such as lily pads, submerged vegetation, and fallen trees to entice Bass to strike.
 Spinnerbaits: Spinnerbaits are versatile lures that can be used to cover water quickly and target Largemouth Bass in a variety of conditions.
Use spinnerbaits with different blade configurations and colors to find what Bass are keying in on, and vary your retrieve speed to trigger strikes.
 Jigs: Jigs are effective for targeting Largemouth Bass in heavy cover such as brush piles, docks, and submerged vegetation.
Pitch or flip jigs into cover and let them sink to the bottom, then work them back with short hops or dragging motions to entice strikes from Bass hiding in cover.
 Soft Plastic Baits: Soft plastic baits such as worms, creature baits, and crawfish imitations are popular choices for targeting Largemouth Bass.
Texas rig, Carolina rig, or wacky rig these baits and fish them around structure, drop-offs, and weed edges to entice strikes from Bass.
 Crankbaits: Crankbaits are effective for covering water quickly and targeting Largemouth Bass holding near structure or along weed lines.
Choose crankbaits that dive to the desired depth and vary your retrieve speed to trigger reaction strikes from Bass.
 Drop Shot: The drop shot rig is a finesse technique that can be effective for targeting Largemouth Bass in clear water or when Bass are finicky.
Use a drop shot rig with a soft plastic bait such as a worm or finesse bait and work it slowly along the bottom or suspend it at mid-depth to entice strikes.
 Flipping and Pitching: Flipping and pitching are precision casting techniques that are effective for targeting Largemouth Bass in heavy cover.
Use a heavy baitcasting setup with a jig, creature bait, or Texas-rigged soft plastic and make accurate casts into tight spaces to target Bass holding in cover.
 Experiment with different techniques, lures, and presentations to find what works best for the conditions you are fishing in and the behavior of Largemouth Bass in your area. Pay attention to water temperature, weather patterns, and the natural forage available to Bass to increase your chances of success.  Seasonal Largemouth Techniques:  Largemouth Bass fishing techniques can vary depending on the season and the behavior of the fish. Here are some effective techniques for targeting Largemouth Bass in each season:
 Spring: In spring, Largemouth Bass are often found in shallow waters near spawning areas. Target them around shallow cover such as vegetation, fallen trees, and docks.
 Use spinnerbaits, crankbaits, and soft plastic lures like worms and creature baits to mimic baitfish and trigger strikes.
 Slowly work your lures around cover and structure, as Bass may be more lethargic in the cooler water temperatures.
 Summer:
In summer, Largemouth Bass tend to move to deeper water or seek out cooler, shaded areas during the heat of the day.
 Target Bass near weed edges, drop-offs, and underwater structure using topwater lures, jigs, and swimbaits.
 Early morning and late evening are prime times to fish for Bass in summer when they are more active and feeding.
 Fall:
In fall, Largemouth Bass are actively feeding to prepare for the upcoming winter months. Target them around shallow cover and structure as they fatten up.
 Use crankbaits, jerkbaits, and lipless crankbaits to imitate fleeing baitfish and trigger strikes.
 Focus on areas where Bass are feeding on schools of baitfish, such as near points, creek mouths, and submerged vegetation.
 Winter:
In winter, Largemouth Bass become less active and tend to move to deeper, more stable water temperatures.

Target Bass in deeper water near structure, drop-offs, and underwater humps using jigs, spoons, and slow-moving soft plastic lures.

Fish slowly and methodically, as Bass are less likely to chase fast-moving lures in cold water.

Regardless of the season, it''s important to adapt your fishing techniques to the behavior and preferences of Largemouth Bass. Experiment with different lures, presentations, and locations to find what works best for the conditions you are fishing in. Pay attention to water temperature, weather patterns, and the natural forage available to Bass in each season to increase your chances of success.

Shoal bass are generally olive green to nearly black along the back. A dusky dark blotch about 50-67 percent of the size of the eye occurs on the back edge of the gill cover. Three diagonal black lines radiate along the side of the head looking like war paint. 10-15 vertical blotches appear along the sides with tiger-stripes often appearing in between.

The belly is creamy or white and wavy lines may appear slightly above the white belly on the sides. The dorsal, caudal and anal fins are dark olive green to grayish black. Pelvic fins may have a cream colored leading edge with dark spots.

The shoal bass has scales on the base portion of the soft-rayed dorsal fins, clearly connected first and second dorsal fins, and an upper jaw bone that does not extend beyond the eyes.

Some Shoal Bass have been known to reach more than eight pounds. As a sport fish, specific bag and size limit regulations apply, and you can register a qualifying catch as part of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission''s "Big Catch" program.
', 'Spawning for the Shoal Bass typically occurs from late April into May. Utilizing its anal and pectoral fins to loosen and remove substrate, the male Shoal Bass will excavate a nest in shallow water typically over a gravel or coarse sand substrate. Shoal Bass are also miscellaneous substrate and material nesters that have adhesive eggs that are either attached or occur in clusters on any available substrat.
 
Shoal Bass are nest spawners and guarders. Females swim through the spawning area to choose a nest without apparent courtship from the male. Female Shoal Bass approach the male to initiate the act of spawning act. The male vigorously chases the female from the nest after spawning and guards the eggs and young for 1-3 weeks.

1. Fighting Ability: Shoal Bass are renowned for their strong and spirited fight when hooked, making them a favorite among sport fishermen.

2. Habitat: They thrive in clear, fast-moving waters with rocky or boulder-strewn bottoms, typical of shoals and rapids. This makes the fishing experience more challenging and exciting.

3. Aggressiveness: They are known for their aggressive feeding behavior, which can lead to a thrilling fishing experience as they readily strike at lures or bait.

4. Conservation Status: While not endangered, shoal bass are more sensitive to habitat changes compared to other bass, making conservation an important aspect of their fishing.

Shoal Bass are generally sought after as a sport fish and not commonly used as bait due to their desirability as a catch for recreational fishing.

The dorsal fin is not as deeply notched as the largemouth bass. The upper jaw extends back only in line with the middle of the eye. A four or five  pound fish is considered a trophy in many areas though they are known to grow considerably larger. 

Smallmouth habitats also play a significant role in their coloration, weight, and shape. 

River Smallmouth that live among dark water for instance tend to be rather torpedo shaped and very dark brown to almost black in color in order to be more efficient for feeding. 

Lakeside Smallmouth Bass however (that live in sandy areas for example) tend to be more oval shaped and typically have a lighter yellow brown coloration in order to not only adapt to their environment for hunting, but also for a means of defensive camouflage.

Smallmouth generally gravitate toward rocky areas, stumps (and other cover) as well as sandy bottomed areas of lakes and reservoirs. 

The Smallmouth prefers cooler water temperatures than its cousin the Largemouth Bass, and may be found in both still and moving water.

Because it is intolerant of pollution, the Smallmouth Bass is a good natural indicator of a healthy environment, though it can better adjust to changes in water condition than most trout species.

Though introduced into all major fast-flowing rivers and cool lakes it prefers clear flowing streams and rivers with rock, bedrock and gravel bottoms and numerous riffles, and cool deep water of large, clear reservoirs with boulders and gravel bottoms. Most active in 67° to 72°F water, and intolerant of silty, warm and polluted water.', 'In conventional fishing, Smallmouth Bass may be successfully caught on a wide range of natural and artificial baits or lures, including crankbaits, hair jigs, plastic jerkbaits (such as Rapala Husky Jerks or Rapala X-Raps), spinnerbaits, jigs and all types of soft plastic lures including curly tail grubs or tubes with lead head jigs. 

Many anglers enjoy fishing for Smallies starting at sunset and depending on their luck, late into the evening. As the skies begin to darken many avid Smallmouth anglers turn to their topwater noise makers such as poppers, buzz baits, jitter bugs, torpedos and the like. An angler will know if their lure is in hot pursuit because of a distinct "whoosh" sound trailing the lure. This noise is created by the Smallmouth aggressively trying to inhale the lure as it makes it''s noisy way across the water surface. It is not uncommon to hear a repeated "whoosh" sound on the same retrieval. A voracious Smallie may attempt to hit the same lure several times before it gives up or is ultimately hooked. This cast and listen technique is extremely exciting and is even better when the moonlight allows the angler to see the surface being broken upon retrieval.

Smallmouth may also be caught with a fly rod using a dry or wet fly, nymphs, streamers, or imitations of larger aquatic creatures such as crawfish or leeches. Floating topwater popper fly patterns and buzz baits are also popular for smallmouth fishing.

Smallmouth bass anglers may also use live bait to catch fish. Live nightcrawlers, minnows, hellgrammites, crayfish, bloodworms and leeches. are the most productive live baits.

For river fishing, spinning tackle or fly tackle have been the most popular angling tools for Smallmouth in North America for many years. Many fisherman use a 5.5-6.5 foot, medium-fast action rod matched with 4-8 lb. test line. 

Fly fishing for Smallmouth Bass has become increasingly popular in recent years, and most fly fishermen seeking river or stream Smallmouth typically use a 4-9 foot fly rod in a #5, #6, #7, or #8-weight size with a floating or sink-tip fly line, depending upon the water to be fished. 

Fishermen seeking Smallmouth in large lakes often use sinking lines of various densities, as Smallmouth found in such waters often feed at greater depths. Smallmouth are not leader shy and will take larger lures and flies, though shallow streams and tight quarters may call for a shorter rod and lighter lines than are generally used for lakes or large rivers.', 'Smallmouth Bass spawn from late April to early June when water  temperatures exceed 60°F.

Grass carp have been introduced to many countries around the world. In the Northern Hemisphere, countries and territories of introduction include Taiwan, Israel, Japan, the Philippines, the United States, Mexico, India, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Denmark, Sweden, Romania, Poland, Italy, West Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.[citation needed] In the Southern Hemisphere, they have been introduced to Argentina, Venezuela, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. Grass carp are known to have spawned and established self-reproducing populations in only six of the many larger Northern Hemisphere rivers into which they have been stocked. Their failure to establish populations in other rivers suggests they have quite specific reproductive requirements.

In the United States, the species was first imported in 1963 from Taiwan and Malaysia to aquaculture facilities in Alabama and Arkansas. The first release is believed to have been an accidental escape in 1966 from the US Fish and Wildlife Service''s Fish Farming Experimental Station in Stuttgart, Arkansas, followed by planned introductions beginning in 1969.Subsequently there have been widespread authorized, illegal, and accidental introductions; by the 1970s the species had been introduced to 40 states, and it has since been reported in 45 of the country’s 50 states. In 2013 it was determined to be reproducing in the Great Lakes Basin. It is still stocked in many states as an effective biocontrol for undesirable aquatic vegetation, many species of which are themselves introduced.

Grass carp require long rivers for the survival of the eggs and very young fish.
', 'Grass carp grow large and are strong fighters on a rod and reel, but because of their vegetarian habits and their wariness, they can be difficult to catch. Chumming with corn adds to success. They will eat canned corn, cherry tomatoes, and, despite their primarily herbivorous habits, will also sometimes eat other animals. Chumming with white bread, and a piece of bread pinched on a hook and floated on the surface works well, especially for pond grass carp. 

Where grass carp populations are maintained through stocking as a biocontrol for noxious weeds, fishers are typically asked to return any caught to the water alive and unharmed.

The fish are popular among bowfishers where bowfishing for them is legal in most states.', 'Spawning typically occurs in the spring when water temperatures reach 59-63°F, and under rising water conditions. Eggs are semi-pelagic and must remain suspended during the 20-40 hour incubation period. Therefore, long river stretches are usually necessary for successful spawning. 

Once young grass carp reach approximately three inches in length, they become nearly 100% herbivorous. Their feeding habits make them ideal as vegetation control agents, as they are capable of consuming 40% to 300% of their body weight per day in plant material. The species shows a high tolerance for salinity; specimens have been known to survive for several days in water up to three times as salty as sea water.

Some species of Asian carp cause harm when they are introduced to new environments. The black carp feeds on native mussels and snails, some of which can be already endangered. Grass carp can alter the food webs of a new environment by altering the communities of plants, invertebrates, and fish. Silver carp feed on the plankton necessary for larval fish and native mussels.

The silver carp is sometimes called the flying carp for its tendency to leap from the water when startled; it can leap up to 10 ft (3.0 m) into the air. Boaters traveling in uncovered high-speed watercraft have been reported to be injured by running into the fish while at speed. A leaping silver carp broke the jaw of a teenager being pulled on an inner tube, and water skiing in areas where silver carp are present is extremely dangerous.

Because of their plankton-feeding habits, they are thought to compete with native planktivorous fishes, which in North America include paddlefish (Polyodon spathula), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), and young fish of almost all species.

Because they feed on plankton, they are sometimes successfully used for controlling water quality, especially in the control of noxious blue-green algae (cyanobacteria). Certain species of blue-green algae however, notably the often toxic Microcystis, can pass through the gut of silver carp unharmed, picking up nutrients in the process. Thus, in some cases, blue-green algae blooms have been exacerbated by silver carp. Microcystis has also been shown to produce more toxins in the presence of silver carp. These carp, which have natural defenses to their toxins, sometimes can contain enough algal toxins in their systems to become hazardous to eat.', 'Cyprinidae', 'Hypophthalmichthys molitrix', 'Least Concern', 'Silver carp were imported to North America in the 1970s to control algae growth in aquaculture and municipal wastewater treatment facilities, but escaped from captivity soon after their importation and are now considered a highly invasive species.

Silver carp, with the closely related bighead carp, often reach extremely high population densities, and are thought to have undesirable effects on the environment and native species. They have spread into the Mississippi, Illinois, Ohio, and Missouri Rivers and many of their tributaries in the United States and are abundant in the Mississippi River watershed from Louisiana to South Dakota and Illinois. Navigation dams seem to have slowed their advance up the Mississippi River, and until late November 2008, silver carp had not been captured north of central Iowa on the Mississippi. Dams that do not have navigation locks are complete barriers to upstream natural movement of silver carp, unless fishermen unintentionally assist this movement by the use of silver carp as bait.', 'Silver carp are filter feeders, thus are difficult to catch on typical hook-and-line gear. Special methods have been developed for these fish, the most important being the "suspension method", usually consisting of a large dough ball that disintegrates slowly, surrounded by a nest of tiny hooks embedded in the bait. The entire apparatus is suspended below a large bobber. The fish feed on the small particles released from the dough ball and bump against the dough ball, with the intention of breaking off more small particles that can be filtered from the water, eventually becoming hooked on the tiny hooks.

In some areas, it is also legal to use "snagging gear", in which large, weighted treble hooks are jerked through the water, to snag the fish. In the United States, silver carp are also popular targets for bowfishermen; they are shot both in the water and in the air. In the latter case, boats are used to scare the fish and entice them to jump, and the fish are shot when they jump.

The upper jaw is slightly longer than the lower jaw, and chin barbels are black to dark gray. (Dark chin barbells easily separate the young of this species from young of the yellow bullhead, Ameiurus natalis, which always have yellow or white barbels.) Teeth on the dorsal and pectoral spines are poorly developed. The back is uniformly dark olive to black, grading to pale yellow, light brown or white on the venter. Fins are dusky and occasionally darkened along their margins.

The black bullhead is a species of bullhead catfish. Like other bullhead catfish, they have the ability to thrive in waters that are low in oxygen, brackish, turbid and/or very warm.[1]. Like virtually all catfish, they are nocturnal, preferring to feed at night, although young will feed during the day. They are omnivorous and eat almost anything from grains, insects, dead or living fish and crustaceans. They generally do not get as large as the channel or blue catfish, with average adult weights in the 1 to 2 pound range, and almost never as large as 5 pounds.

Like most of the bullheads (and even the cousin flathead catfish) it has a squared tail fin, which is strikingly different than the forked tail of channel and blue catfish. Their color will depend on the area they are taken from, but are generally darker than brown or yellow bullheads. They can be distinguished from flatheads in that their lower lip does not protrude past the upper lip. Distinguishing from the brown bullhead is a bit more difficult, depending on the area they are caught from, but a distinguishing detail between the two include a nearly smooth pectoral spine on the black bullhead with the brown being strongly barbed. The anal fin also has a gray base, and the tail also has a pale bar.

', 'Flathead hunt mainly at night. In order to catch them during the day, you have to get your bait very close to where the fish is laying up. They won''t move very far to take a bait during the day. In order to do that, you will have to spend a lot of time learning about their habits. You also will need to know exactly what is under the water in the river where you fish. If you don''t know what''s down there, you can''t know where the fish are. 

Flatheads prefer live bait. It is not very likely to catch many Flatheads on dough bait, dip bait or cut bait. One of the best bait for flatheads is live perch or other small baitfish. 

Use at least 20 pound test line. You can use lighter line, but flatheads are found in the logs & sticks so you''ll hang up quite a bit. Slide a sinker on the line then tie a large swivel on the end. The sinker needs to be free to move up & down the line. This allows the fish to take the hook without feeling the weight of the sinker. The line just slides through it. The weight of the sinker depends on how fast the current is moving. A 2 ounce sinker will typically suffice. The swivel needs to be large enough to keep the sinker from sliding past it. It has two jobs. The first is to keep your line from twisting up. The second it to keep the weight away from the hook. This will let your bait swim freely in a small area. You will need a leader attached to the swivel with your hook on the other end. Leaders between 12 and 18 inches long are recommended, depending on how much cover is around for the bait to get tangled in. Hook range should fall between 3/0 to a 5/0. Be sure to note that a 3/0 is a whole lot bigger than a 3. Don''t get them confused. Hook the bait through the flesh in front of the tail. Some people hook them in front of & below the dorsal fin which works too. Hooking through the tail is believed to cause the baitfish to struggle more so it sends out more vibrations. 

Fish on the bottom. During the day, if you haven''t gotten a bite in about 15 minutes, it''s time to move. You don''t need to move very far however. A few yards is generally plenty. That goes back to knowing the river & knowing the fish. The best way to get started is to find someone to take you with them & show you the ropes.

While it does not truly walk as most bipeds or quadrupeds do, it has the ability to use its pectoral fins to keep it upright as it makes a sort of wiggling motion with snakelike movements. 

The walking catfish has an elongated body shape, and reaches almost 1.6 ft in length and 2.6 lb in weight. Often covered laterally in small white spots, the body is mainly colored gray or grayish brown. This catfish has long-based dorsal and anal fins, as well as several pairs of sensory barbels. The skin is scaleless, but covered with mucus, which protects the fish when it is out of water.

Considerable taxonomic confusion surrounds this species and it has frequently been confused with other close relatives. One main distinction between the walking catfish and native North American ictalurid catfish is the walking catfish''s lack of an adipose fin.

', 'Clariidae', 'Clarias batrachus', 'Least Concern', 'The walking catfish is a species of freshwater airbreathing catfish native to Southeast Asia, but also introduced outside its native range where it is considered an invasive species.

This walking catfish thrives in slow-moving and often stagnant muddy waters in ponds, swamps, streams, rivers, canals, ditches  or temporary pools which may dry up. When this happens, its "walking" skill allows the fish to move to other sources of water. 

Walking catfish have been know to invade aquaculture farms and eat large amounts of fish stock.  Fish farmers in Florida have had to put up fences or build levees to keep them out.  An additional threat to catfish fisheries, specifically, is the fact that wild walking catfish carry the disease enteric septicemia (ESC) caused by the bacterium Edwadsiella ictaluri.  Wild walking catfish could infect farmed catfish with the disease.

The species spends most of its time on, or right above, the bottom, with occasional trips to the surface to gulp air.', 'Let’s start out by stating that this fish needs to be handled carefully when fishing it due to its hidden embedded sting or thorn-like defensive mechanism hidden behind its fins (including the middle ones before the tail fin, like the majority of all catfishes).

Like most catfish, walking catfish are omnivores and can be caught using a variety of natural and prepared baits including crickets, nightcrawlers, minnows, shad, crawfish, frogs, bullheads, sunfish, and suckers. 

Some catfish have even been known to take Ivory Soap as bait. Another method of catching walking catfish as well as many other species of cats is using stinkbaits, which are prepared baits made of things such as dead fish, crawfish, garlic, blood, meat, cheese, dough, and even Kool-Aid powder. Sometimes these stinkbaits are prepared into a dough ball and mashed onto a hook, other times they are smeared in special tubes meant to hold the formulated bait, but all are typically fished slowly on the bottom. 

Many additional baits can be purchased at the local grocery store such as chicken livers, shrimp, dog food and bubble gum.', 'Walking catfish appear to be sexually mature from around 12″ (30cm) in size. Breeding pairs become territorial. Water chemistry and temperature is not critical as this fish can survive and breed in a wide variety of water types and qualities.

Prior to spawning body contact between a breeding pair increases and they can be observed swimming side-by-side. These fish often spawn in caves dug into the banks of rivers, but if no such cave capable bank is available they will dig a pit in the waterbody substrate and deposit the eggs into this. The event itself can last as long as 20 hours, with the pair coming together many times above the spawning site. Many eggs are laid (several thousand may be produced by large pairs) and these sink immediately, adhering to the substrate where they fall.

Following spawning, the female retreats and the male assumes protection of the brood, swimming tirelessly above the nest in anticipation of potential predators. It may also be that the currents produced by his unceasing movements assist in the development of the eggs. The eggs hatch within 24-36 hours at which point the female again begins to assist in brood care, assuming responsibility for guarding the perimeters of the territory. The male remains at the nest for around another 48 hours at which point the adults begin to lose interest in the fry. Within 2-4 days, the young become free swimming at which point they begin to feed on brine shrimp and other microorganisms, but grow rapidly and are soon big enough to consume larger prey.', 'Aquatic vegetation, aquatic insects, crustaceans, small fish, small mollusks', 'AZ, CA, FL, GA, NV', 'Bog, Canal, Lake, Pond, River, Stream, Swamp', '1-2', 'Walking Catfish are best known for:

It is very similar to the European eel, but the two species differ in number of chromosomes and vertebrae.

The eel lives in fresh water and only leaves this habitat to enter the ocean for spawning. It takes 9 to 10 weeks for the eggs to hatch. After hatching, young eels move toward North America and enter freshwater systems to mature. The female can lay up to 4 million buoyant eggs a year, but dies after egg-laying.

The American Eel is typically found around the Atlantic coast including Chesapeake Bay and the Hudson River however  it was originally found in Lesueur, Minnesota back in 1817 and is plentiful in the tributaries of the Mississippi.. It prefers to hunt at night, and during the day it hides in mud, sand or gravel very close to shore, roughly 5 to 6 feet under.

When eels are not migrating, it is easy to find them in medium to large size lakes and streams with quiet waters and muddy bottoms. Eels are more active at night, so they need the mud or underwater objects to be hidden during the day. Freshwater American eels live longer, and there is reference of captive eels living as long as 88 years. 

American eels are economically very important to the East Coast and rivers where they travel. They are caught by fishermen and sold (typically as bait), eaten, or kept as pets. Eels help the Atlantic coast ecosystem by eating dead fish, invertebrates, carrion, insects, and if hungry enough, they will cannibalize each other.

Bluebacks and Alewives are difficult to distinguish; experienced fishermen who recognize the existence of the two separate fish cannot always tell them apart since they so closely resemble one another in general appearance. The most obvious external difference between them is that the back of the blueback is definitely blue green, that of the alewife gray green.

Several North Georgia reservoirs have healthy stocked populations of muskie. They are also found in the Red River drainage of the Hudson Bay basin. They prefer clear waters where they lurk along weed edges, rock outcrops or other structures to rest. A fish forms two distinct home ranges in summer: a shallow range and a deeper one. The shallow range is generally much smaller than the deeper range due to shallow water heating up. A musky will continually patrol the ranges in search of available food in the appropriate conditions of water temperature,', 'Anglers seek large muskies as trophies or for sport. The fish attain impressive swimming speeds but are not particularly maneuverable. The highest speed runs are usually fairly short, but they can be quite intense.

A challenging fish to catch, the muskie has been called "the fish of ten thousand casts." Anglers tend to use smaller lures in spring or during cold front conditions and larger lures in fall or the heat of summer. The average lure is 20–30 cm (7.9–12 in) long but longer lures of 35–65 cm (14–26 in) are not uncommon in the musky angler''s arsenal. Anglers are strongly encouraged to practice catch and release when fishing for muskellunge.', 'Muskellunge are sometimes gregarious, forming small schools over places of structure. 

They spawn in mid to late spring, somewhat later than Northern Pike, over shallow, vegetated areas. Rock or sand bottom is preferred for spawning so that the eggs don''t sink into the muck and suffocate. 

The male Muskellunge arrive first and attempt to establish dominance over a territory. Spawning may last from five to ten days and occurs mainly at night. The zygotes are negatively buoyant and slightly adhesive; they adhere to plants and the bottom of the lake. Soon afterwards they are abandoned by the adults. Those embryos which are not eaten by fish, insects or crayfish hatch within two weeks.

The paddlefish can be distinguished by its large mouth and its elongated snout called a rostrum (bill). These spatula-like snouts comprise half the length of their entire body. There are only two extant species of these fish: the Chinese and the American paddlefish.

These fish are not closely related to sharks, but they do have some body parts that resemble those of sharks such as their skeletons, primarily composed of cartilage, and deeply forked heterocercal tail fins.

 In May 2000, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the Paddlefish as being extirpated in Canada. The American paddlefish is one of the largest freshwater fish in North America. They commonly reach 5 feet (1.5 m) or more in length and can weigh more than 60 pounds (27 kg). The largest American paddlefish on record was caught in Kansas and weighed 144 pounds (65 kg), by Clinton Boldridge out of Atchison Watershed. The largest unofficial record was 206 pounds from Lake Cumberland in Kentucky.[citation needed] Postcards from the 1960s show a photo of this huge fish. This type of fish''s age is hard to determine but many scientists[who?] think that they live 50 years or more.

Early investigators[who?] once thought that paddlefishes used their snouts to dig vegetation from the bottom of lakes and rivers. In fact, they feed by filtering out zooplankton from the water, using filaments on their gill arches called gill rakers.

The rostrum contains receptors in it that can detect weak electrical fields, suggesting that they use their rostrum as an antenna to detect zooplankton.[3] Even though the rostrum seems to help the fish feed, fish with severely damaged or missing rostrums are able to feed and are just as healthy as other fish with them intact.
The rostrum also helps the fish to feed by acting as a stabilizer. As the fish moves through the water with its mouth open, the rostrum creates lift, much like a wing of an airplane. This helps the fish by keeping its head in a steady position and helps it keep from diving to the bottom.


', 'Polyodontidae', 'Polyodon spathula', 'Near Threatened', 'The American Paddlefish lives in the slow-flowing waters of the Mississippi River, Missouri River, Des Moines River, Yellowstone River, Ohio River, Wisconsin River, and Oklahoma River systems and was historically found in the Great Lakes.', 'In some states, paddlefish are abundant enough to allow for sport fishing though a citation is needed.   Catching paddlefish is typically achieved with a bow and arrow, a spear, or by snagging. Because paddlefish are filter feeders, they cannot be caught with conventional lures.   For snagging, anglers typically use a large treble hook 2/0 to 4/0 in size which is weighted heavily to pull the hook to the bottom. Heavy duty rods, 7'' to 15'' in length with a heavy duty reel and line, complete the rig which the angler moves in a sweeping motion to hook the fish in the fins or tail. 

A common fishing method in many areas is a heavy action rod 5''-6'' in length with 100 lb+ braided line, 10/0 or 12/0 treble hook and 8-12oz sinker and a Penn 309 size/type reel capable of holding approximately 150 yards of line.   Specialty rods are sold at BassPro shops called "Snaggin Special". Using a boat in slow idle, the rod is pulled rapidly in a low sweeping motion, pausing for the weight to settle on bottom and repeat.   Hooking into a Paddlefish will feel as if you snagged on the bottom. In warmer water, the fish will put up a short lived hard charging fight occasionally jumping clear of the surface depending on the location the fish was hooked and then it will resemble dragging up "dead weight" as the fish rolls and wraps line around itself. 40-50 lb females are common in the Spring in some areas of the US.', 'When Paddlefish mature, at about age 9 to 10 for males and age 16 to 17 for females, they migrate up river to spawn. Adult fish do not as a rule die after spawning, but we know from tagging studies that a given female only spawns about every 3 years, and a given male about every 2 years.

The males and females have evolved different strategies for reproducing and passing on their genes to the next generation. The larger a female is, the more eggs she can produce, and the more young paddlefish she will probably produce. A male gains less by becoming large because even a small male will have millions of sperm--enough to fertilize all of the eggs from the largest female. It is preferable for males to mature at a younger age than females so they may reproduce more often, as opposed to taking the time to grow large, risking death before they spawn. Conversely, a female benefits more from the gamble she takes in delaying maturity because of the additional eggs she will produce.

It is an obligate air breather as it utilizes a suprabranchial organ and a bifurcate ventral aorta that permits aquatic and aerial respiration. This unusual respiratory system allows it to live outside of water for several days, which causes concern that it might wriggle or walk its way to other nearby bodies of water or be able to survive and escape when transported by humans. It has been noted however, that only juveniles are able to move over land for short distances so large scale terrestrial migrations seem to be somewhat of an urban legend. ', 'Channidae', 'Channa argus', 'Least Concern', 'The preferred habitat of the northern snakehead species are stagnant water with a muddy substrate and aquatic vegetation, or slow muddy streams. ', 'The northern snakehead is considered to be an extremely invasive species that can cause serious trauma to the native aquatic environment.   Northern snakeheads can be caught on several lures and baits similar to those used for bass and other large freshwater gamefish.

Anglers in VA who think they may have caught a snakehead fish are asked NOT to release it, but to call the Department''s in-state toll-free, 24-hour Snakehead Fish Hotline at 1-800-770-4951 (out-of-state callers should call directly to 804-367-1258) for a positive identification of the fish. 

Be sure you know how to identify a snakehead and how to distinguish one from the native species of bowfin and American eel before taking any drastic measures. Some tips are detailed below as a quick reference.
 Northern Snakehead:
The pelvic fins are close to the pectoral fins and gills.  
The anal fin is extended (typically about 3/4 the length of the dorsal fin) 
Dark blotches are present somewhat resembling the patterns seen in camouflage worn by hunters.  Bowfin:
The pelvic fins are set back from the gills and pectoral fin and are rounder in shape than that of the Northern Snakehead.  
The anal fin is short and rounded.  • There is also a black spot at the base of the Bowfin’s tail which is not present on the Northern Snakehead. 
Mottled markings on the sides more wormlike in appearance as opposed to the larger and distinct markings seen on the Northern Snakehead.  American Eel:
The American Eel is actually more “snakelike” than the Northern Snakehead and typically considerably smaller in girth. 
The American Eel typically has no markings as opposed to the Northern Snakehead and Bowfin. 
The American Eel has no pelvic fin. 
The dorsal and anal fins are extremely elongated and merge with the caudal fin appearing as one continuous fin. ', 'The northern snakehead reaches sexual maturity by age 2 or 3. Each spawning-age female can release up to 15,000 eggs at once. Snakeheads can mate as often as five times a year. This means in just two years, a single female can release up to 150,000 eggs.', 'Fish, crayfish, insect larvae, beetles, amphibians', 'AR, CA, FL, MA, MD, NC, NH, NY, PA, VA', 'Bog, Lake, Pond, River, Stream, Swamp', '5-15', 'The Northern Snakehead is known for several intriguing attributes, particularly in the context of fishing and ecology:

1. Aggressive Predators: Northern Snakeheads are highly aggressive and predatory, known for their voracious appetite and ability to prey on a variety of aquatic organisms, including other fish, amphibians, and even small mammals and birds.

2. Hard Fighting Fish: Anglers prize Northern Snakeheads for their aggressive strikes and strong, vigorous fights when hooked, making them an exciting challenge for sport fishing.

3. Unique Appearance: They have an elongated, torpedo-shaped body with a distinctive large mouth, sharp teeth, and long dorsal fin. Their unique appearance adds to their appeal as an exotic catch.

4. Adaptability: Northern Snakeheads are highly adaptable and can survive in a variety of aquatic environments, including both still waters and fast-flowing rivers. They are also capable of breathing air, which allows them to survive in low-oxygen conditions and even move short distances over land.

5. Reputation as an Invasive Species: In some regions, particularly in the United States, Northern Snakeheads are considered an invasive species. They can have significant impacts on local ecosystems by out-competing native species for resources.

6. Culinary Use: While not as commonly consumed as some other fish, Northern Snakeheads are edible and considered a delicacy in some cuisines, known for their firm, white meat.

It was in great abundance when the first settlers came to America, but has since declined due to overfishing and water pollution. It is considered threatened, endangered and even extinct in much of its original habitats. The fish can reach sixty years of age, fifteen feet in length and over eight hundred pounds in weight.

Rather than having true scales, the Atlantic sturgeon has five rows of bony plates known as scutes. Specimens weighing over eight hundred pounds and nearly fifteen feet in length have been recorded, but they typically grow to be six to eight feet and no more than three hundred pounds. Its coloration ranges from bluish-black and olive green on its back to white on its underside. It has a longer snout than other sturgeons and has four barbels at the side of its mouth.

Atlantic sturgeon under six years of age stay in the brackish water where they were born before moving into the ocean. They may be 3 to 5 feet long at this stage. In areas where the Shortnose sturgeon are also present, the adults of that species can be, and historically were for centuries, confused with immature Atlantic sturgeon. Atlantic sturgeon may take anywhere from seven to twenty-three years to become sexually mature, depending on the sex and temperature of the water. 

Sturgeon can often live to the age of sixty years old. Accounts of sturgeon over the age of one hundred were not uncommon in colonial times. The species is also known for its occasional ''leaping'' behavior, during which the fish will emerge completely out of the water in a forceful motion that can be hazardous to anything unlucky enough to be struck. The exact reason why sturgeon leap remains unknown.

Atlantic Sturgeon are endangered and it is illegal to catch or keep them in most states.

Juveniles are believed to feed on benthic insects and crustaceans. Mollusks and large crustaceans are the primary food of adult Shortnose Sturgeon.', 'Shortnose Sturgeon are officially listed as endangered in all states where it occurs. It is unlwaful to kill or possess this fish.

Any angler that happens to catch a Shortnose Sturgeon should release it as quickly and safely as possible.', 'Shortnose Sturgeon spawn in fresh water, above the head of the tide, in moving water over rubble or gravel bottoms with little silt or organic material. Time of spawning varies by latitude and is likely based on water temperatures in the range from 50º-53º F degrees Fahrenheit although successful spawning can occur from 40º-60º F. This may be as early as January in South Carolina or Georgia or as late as May in Maine and New Brunswick.

Other spawning requirements include a day length of 14-15 hours, and water velocity at the bottom of 11-50 inches per second. The eggs hatch after 13 days, into 7–11 mm long hatchlings with a large yolk-sac, minimal sight, minimal swimming ability and a strong tendency to seek cover. 

After another 9–12 days they mature to a swimming larval stage at about 15 mm in length, resembling a miniature adult by the time they reach 20mm in length and begin feeding. 

The juvenile Shortnose Sturgeon then drift downstream in the deep channels of the river, remaining in fresh water for the first year of their life. Juveniles, up to 18 inches long, generally move to the area where fresh and salt water come together, and move with it through the tidal cycle.

Adults can be found in either fresh or salt water. Adults mature sexually at 18 to 22 inches in length, at an age varying with latitude. Males mature after 2–3 years in Georgia or 10–14 years in New Brunswick, and females mature between 6 and 17 years of age (again, earlier in southern rivers). First spawning occurs after sexual maturity; 1–2 years later for males and up to 5 years later for females. 

Adults continue to grow to between 3 and 4 feet in length. A male may breed every year or every other year, and seldom lives beyond age 30. 

Females usually breed every third to fifth year, laying between 40,000 and 200,000 eggs in those years that they breed, and can live up to around age 70. Females spend multiple years with reduced feeding and growth while they are producing the gonadal material needed for spawning.

The fins are a dusky, opaque gray. The underside is a clean white. It has four barbels, used for sensing food, near its large, toothless mouth.

Sturgeons are classified as a bony fish, but actually are more cartilaginous than bony, their internal bone structure being more like a shark''s. Sturgeon have changed very little since they first appeared over 175 million years ago and as such have the appearance of being prehistoric.', 'Acipenseridae', 'Acipenser transmontanus', 'Least Concern', 'White sturgeon are well-adapted to finding food drifting by with their excellent sense of smell and taste. When the food supply is insufficient, sturgeon have been known to move into shallow water to eat freshwater clams.

A sturgeon''s taste buds are located on the outside of its mouth. This, along with the barbels, allows it to see if a possible food source is edible before sucking it up into its mouth. As adults, the white sturgeon''s diet somewhat varies. This is dependent upon the river systems in which it lives. 

In the Columbia River system, dead fish, crustaceans, and mollusks are all popular prey. Lampreys, primitive eel-like fish, come into rivers to spawn at the same time as the white sturgeon, and are a popular food source in the moment. 

Smelt are another abundant food around spawning time. Shad come into the Columbia River system in throngs of several million each spring. The extremely large shad runs are often cited as an example of why the lower Columbia River has such a large population of sturgeon. Like the smelt, these fish often die, and the remains are an easy meal for sturgeon.

In most years, anglers'' regulations change frequently to limit the number of fish caught. Once the annual quota is reached, retention of sturgeon is no longer allowed. 

Also, one may only use a single-point barbless hook. Bait used for sturgeon is mostly its natural prey including shad, anchovies, shrimp, and smelt, however, more unusual baits are sometimes used -these baits include cheese, anchovies, pickled squid, dog food, and cat food.', 'During the spawning season, the white sturgeon moves to clean, fast-moving areas of rivers, such as just below rapids, with gravel or larger rocks along the bottom.

White sturgeon spawn many times in their lives. As they age, the females spawn less often, but produce more eggs in each spawning. In the late spring or early summer, they congregate in areas of rivers with a heavy current, gravel bottom, and a water temperature of 58 to 66°F (14 to 19°C). The fish broadcast spawn in these areas, with males releasing sperm as the outnumbered females release 100,000 to a million eggs. The fertilized eggs then sink and adhere to the gravel at the bottom. The eggs are brown in color and hatch in about a week, depending on water temperature. Female white sturgeon do not spawn every year.

Upon hatching, the larvae are around 0.5 in (1.3 cm) long, with a tadpole-like appearance. They drift downstream with the current until they reach a suitable habitat. When the rearing habitat is reached, the larvae typically take around 25 days for the yolk sac to be absorbed. About a month after hatching, the sturgeon have a full set of fins, rays, and scutes. As small juveniles, they feed on insects, small fish, and small crustaceans. Maturity is reached between 5 and 11 years, depending on the gender of the fish and the temperature of the water.

White sturgeon can live to be over 100 years old. The rate of growth is dependent on water temperature. Typically, they reach six feet long around 25 years of age, showing that these fish do not grow as quickly as many other fish. They are anadromous, meaning they spawn in fresh water and migrate to salt water to mature. Sturgeon may migrate in and out of salt water many times in their lives. However, since the building of many dams along the Columbia and Snake Rivers, the populations above the dams have become landlocked.

Groups of young fish school close to shore, but adults tend to travel in groups of 2-4 in slightly deeper yet still covered waters. Pumpkinseeds are active throughout the day, but they rest at night near the bottom or in protected areas in rocks or near submerged logs.

Some pumpkinseeds have shown a strong instinct for a home range. When captured fish were marked and released in a different part of the lake, a significant percentage of them returned to their original location.', 'Because they tend to remain in the shallows and feed all day, Pumpkinseeds are relatively easy to catch from shore.

They may be easy to catch and popular with the youngest anglers, but Pumpkinseeds are often sought by adults as well. The fish do put up an aggressive fight on line, and they have an excellent flavor and are low in fat and high in protein. Be careful when handling as Pumpkinseeds have sharp spines as do most sunfish.
', 'When water temperatures reach 55-63 degrees F (typically late spring or early summer), male Pumpkinseeds start to build nests to spawn. Spawning sites are generally in shallow water from 6 inches to several feet deep on sand or gravel bottoms. The males use their caudal fins to sweep out shallow, saucer-shaped depressions about twice the length of the fish in diameter (about 4 to 15 inches). The fish remove larger objects like rocks by pulling them out with their mouths.

Nests are built in colonies of 3 to 15 nest sites. Sometimes pumpkinseeds build nests in bluegill nest colonies, and the two species will interbreed. Males vigorously defend their nests with typical sunfish aggressive behavior—spreading of the opercula, charging, biting, chasing, and, rarely, mouth-fighting. Pumpkinseeds maintain larger territories than bluegills.

Females arrive after the nests are completed, coming in from deeper waters. At first the females appear to be chased away from the nest by the males, but after a considerable amount of chasing, the females head toward the nest instead of away from it. Once the female is in the nest, the pair swims in circles side by side, with the bellies of both fish touching. The male then releases milt and the female releases eggs. Females may spawn in more than one nest, and more than one female may use the same nest. Sometimes more than one female will spawn with a male simultaneously. Females produce 1,500 to 1,700 eggs, depending on their size and age.

The small eggs stick to gravel, sand, or debris in the nest, and they hatch in as little as three days at 82.4 degrees F. Females leave the nest immediately after spawning, but males remain and are highly protective, guarding the eggs and fanning them. The newly hatched young are minute and transparent, for some time only the eyes are visible. The male guards them for about the first 11 days, returning them to the nest in his mouth if they try to stray. Fathers may even nip at people’s hands or feet that come close to their nests.

The young fish stay on or near the shallow breeding area and grow to about 2 inches in their first year. Sexual maturity is usually achieved by age 2.

Redbreasts often occupy beds that have been abandoned by other sunfishes. Spawning occurs from May through August when water temperatures range from 68 to 82 degrees. 

Males are the nest builders and guard the eggs and larvae for a short period after hatching.

1. Vivid Coloration: As its name suggests, the Redbreast Sunfish is famous for its bright orange to red breast and belly, with a body that features a mix of olive, blue, green, and golden hues. This vibrant appearance makes them popular among anglers and aquarium enthusiasts alike.

2. Habitat Variety: They are commonly found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, rivers, and streams, often near vegetation, overhanging banks, or rocky areas where they can find food and shelter.

3. Size: Redbreast Sunfish are medium-sized sunfish, typically growing to around 6 to 8 inches, though they can occasionally reach up to 12 inches in length.

4. Feeding Habits: They are omnivorous and feed on insects, small fish, mollusks, and plants. Their adaptable feeding habits allow them to thrive in various aquatic environments.

5. Schooling Behavior: These fish often group together in schools, which can lead to abundant catches when located by anglers. Their schooling nature makes them accessible and fun to catch.

6. Popular Game Fish: Their feisty attitude and moderate size make Redbreast Sunfish a popular target for recreational fishing. They can be caught using various baits, including worms, small minnows, and artificial lures.

Reduced habitats and enthusiastic anglers have depleted the waters of the short-lived brook trout (whose average life span is four years). Newly developed strains of brook trout with 10-year life spans have been introduced into inland hatcheries. 

Biologists are anxious to see how these strains adapt to living in ''natural'' conditions in the wild. Brook Trout end to be mostly daytime feeders. They are the most colorful of our trout (you’d think that would go to the honors of the trout with the rainbow moniker). The back is a dark olive green with light wavy or wormy markings. Sides are lighter, sometimes with a bluish cast, yellowish spots and red spots with a light blue halo around them. The Brook Trout’s belly is white with bright orange fins. The fins have outer edges of white with a black line separating it from the orange. They typically range from 10 to 16 inches and 1 to 2 lbs. is considered a good-sized brookie. Native brookies seldom grow beyond 12 inches in Mid-Atlantic streams.', 'Salmonidae', 'Salvelinus fontinalis', 'Least Concern', 'The Brook Trout prefers colder, cleaner waters and smaller creeks and beaver ponds. Does best in water temperatures of 68°F or less.', 'Though at times extremely wary, Brook Trout will strike various well-presented lures or baits, if not alerted to the presence of an angler.

Fishing the river pockets and deep pools behind boulders in northern Canada, use fairly large three or four inch red and white, silver, or gold spoon lures. Cast the spoons using medium-weight spinning equipment with eight-pound test line. Other lures attractive to finicky brookies are red and white buck tail flies cast with ultra-light gear and a fly rod.

After the lure is cast, let it submerge beneath the surface, then slowly retrieve. Anglers have little trouble determining when a Brookie is on the line as hooked Brook Trout are bold strikers though they tire easily after being pulled to the surface.

Fishing the small streams of the United States where Brook Trout are found is a challenge. Usually, a large population of Brookies will live near urban areas surrounded by a dense wall of willows or alders. The growth along the small streams limits casting room, and renders some areas nearly inaccessible. Once an angler reaches the stream itself, a gently-presented bait on a No. 8 or 10 hook is a well-liked offering.

Use a fly rod, a four-foot long four-pound test leader, and carefully present the bait. Grasshoppers, crickets, small dead minnows, worms, night crawlers, and caddis worms (from stream bottoms) are all viable choices. Still, the presentation of the bait is more important than the bait itself in most cases. Brook Trout spook and scatter easily, and at times, may demonstrate fussy eating habits.

A well-known ingenious method of presenting bait as naturally as possible is to float the bait on a piece of wood waiting until the wood drifts near the fish. Quietly pull the bait into the water over the desired location, and let it sink to the bottom.

In less brushy areas where a break in the surrounding growth permits space for a short cast, a spinning rod and ultra-light spinning equipment works nicely to flip the bait under overhanging brush. Again, anglers are reminded to quietly approach the stream, to avoid spooking the fish.

Another approach to over-grown-stream fishing is to walk upstream through the middle of the water. Carefully select a small pool, kneel, and gently flip the bait to the far end of the pool with ultra-light spinning gear. Aim for a rock, log or other protruding object, and then gently pull the bait from the structure into the water. Brook Trout usually face upstream, and search for insects that fall into the pools.

In larger streams, Brook Trout avoid the deeper waters where they make easy prey for larger Brown or Cutthroat Trout. Brookies prefer the shallower riffles, shore runs, and the shade offered by undercut banks.

In small beaver ponds and lakes, nervous Brook Trout are wary of large lures. Long, light fly rods or ultra-light spinning equipment with small spinners, spoons, flies, or bait is crucial. After a rain, lures work well to attract the trout in the temporarily discoloured waters. When casting, use the smallest lures possible. Where cool streams meet the ocean, silvery Brook Trout known as "salters" reside. These larger fish are relatively unknown to many anglers, though they offer great sport.

Fishing for Brook Trout in Canada is a gratifying experience. The fish feed in pristine waters, largely untouched by developed urban areas. The tasty pink flesh of the Northern Brook Trout attests to its popularity. In some areas, the Canadian government, in an effort to conserve the remaining population, restricts the bag limit on Brookies to one fish per day.

In the United States, the native Brook Trout populations exist in small, underfished streams and isolated rural areas. In other popular fishing areas, Brook Trout are stocked and quickly captured. A few anglers prefer to stalk the fish only a few times each season, valuing the challenging hunt and unrivaled table fare presented by the modestly sized fish.', 'The Brook Trout spawns in October and November and in many areas of the US and from September to December in southern waters. in the headwaters of small streams, usually the tail of a pool. Female excavates a spot in the gravel and releases her eggs and the male releases milt over them at the same time. The female will fan a lose covering of gravel over the eggs to protect but not smother them. 

Large numbers of fish gather in the mouths of cool streams. At this time, brookies are easy to catch as they lose their usual wary behaviour. During spawning, a few bright-red males may be caught, but any dismally coloured females must be gently released to ensure a future population, and a future fishing sport, exist. Hundreds to thousands of eggs are laid in a shallow depository, called a redd, constructed in the bottom gravel. 35-135 days later, depending on the water temperature, the eggs begin to hatch over a period of weeks.', 'Insect larvae, small fish, crayfish ', 'AL, AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, DC, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, MS, MO, MT, NC, ND, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NY, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, VA, WA, WV, WI, WY

All subspecies of Cutthroat Trout are sought after gamefish, especially among anglers who enjoy fly fishing, however, several native subspecies of Cutthroat Trout are currently listed as threatened, generally due to loss of habitat and introduction of non-native species.

Cutthroat Trout vary widely in size, coloration, and habitats. Though their coloration can range from golden to gray to green on the back, depending on subspecies and habitat, all populations feature distinctive red, pink, or orange marks on the underside of the lower jaw; usually the easiest diagnostic of the species for the casual observer. 

As adults, different populations and subspecies of cutthroat can range from 6–40 inches in length making size an ineffective indicator as to species.

The Cutthroat Trout is the original trout of the Rocky Mountains. Unlike the Brown Trout, which was introduced to the United States, Cutthroat Trout are originally from the western half of the United States.

What separates the Cutthroat Trout from other trout is that, today, they are found primarily in remote and pristine locations. Unlike their larger cousins, the Rainbow Trout and the Brown Trout, Cutthroat Trout tend to fare poorly in highly competitive environments, especially when predatory fish like Pike are introduced into their waters. As such, the range of the Cutthroat Trout has been driven back over the years. While Cutthroat Trout are still found in good numbers on many of the rivers in Montana, the best Cutthroat Trout fishing will usually now be found deep in the backcountry on isolated mountain lakes and streams requiring lots of effort by the angler to reach.

There are many subspecies of Cutthroat Trout, each native to a separate geographic area. 

The Cutthroat Trout is thought to have evolved over the past two million years from other Oncorhynchus species which migrated up the Columbia and Snake river basins. There are at least 10, and perhaps more than 14 subspecies.', 'Salmonidae', 'Oncorhynchus clarkii', 'Least Concern', 'Cutthroat Trout are native to western North America. The cutthroat species has evolved through geographic isolation into many subspecies, each native to a different major drainage basin. 

Native cutthroat species are found along the Pacific Northwest coast, in the Cascade Range, the Great Basin, and throughout the Rocky Mountains. Some coastal populations are anadromous, living primarily in the Pacific Ocean as adults and returning to fresh water from fall through early spring to feed on insects and spawn. 

Most populations, however, stay in freshwater throughout their lives and are known as non-migratory, stream-resident or riverine populations. Anadromous fish may reach weights of 20 pounds, but those fish which remain permanently in freshwater may only reach a weight of 2 pounds. At least three subspecies are confined to isolated basins in the Great Basin and can tolerate saline or alkaline water.', 'The Cutthroat Trout is regarded as one of the best species to target with a fly rod. Nestled away in astonishing landscapes and in some of the most spectacular rivers in North America the Cutthroat Trout entices all who love to fly fish. The real beauty of Cutthroat Trout is that they are a working-man''s fish. Whereas Brown Trout and Brook Trout tend to disappear in days with high sun, Cutthroat Trout are rarely too weary to come out and feed. 

Additionally, there is no real need for those extra-early sunrise starts with Cutthroats as they can be caught throughout the day and into the evening in most cases, which is very convenient for anglers working full time jobs. Nymph flies are a good place for anglers to start if they are fishing a new body of water, or fishing ahead of oncoming storms.   Cutthroat Trout seem to key in on these subsurface presentations and strike nymphs greedily with the coming of inclement weather. Most often Cutthroat are fished for and caught with dry fly patterns emulating stoneflies, caddis flies and mayflies. 

Anglers should look for typical holding cover as Cutthroats are ambush predators. Good Cutthroat cover comes in the form of as eddies, log jams, large boulders, transitions between fast and slow water and oxygenated riffles. 

Over the last few years in heavily fished areas such as the Yellowstone National Park, Cutthroat Trout appear to become quite finicky on some days proving tough to catch. Large Cutthroat Trout have been known to be on-again, off-again in their feeding habits making some fishing trips feel nearly impossible to land the big one while others feel like they will bite on almost anything you throw at them.', 'Cutthroat Trout typically spawn from February to May depending on which region they are in.', 'Fish, invertebrates, shrimp, insect larvae', 'AK, AR, AZ, CA, CO, ID, MT, NM, NV, OR, PA, WA, WY', 'River, Stream', '2-5', 'Cutthroat Trout are highly sought after for their striking appearance and adaptability to various freshwater environments, ranging from small streams to large lakes.

They are closely related to the brook trout, but lack the bright coloration and can be distinguished by a deeply forked tail. 

In most waters, Lake Trout commonly reach lengths of 18 to 24 inches and weights of 2 to 4 pounds. They are among the longest lived and largest freshwater game fish, often living 20 years or more and attaining sizes of over 30 inches and 10 pounds.', 'Salmonidae', 'Salvelinus namaycush', 'Least Concern', 'Lake Trout prefer large, deep, cold lakes in which they spend their entire lives.', 'A general knowledge of Lake Trout habits can pay dividends to the angler. In spring, when lake waters are cold, trout can be found near the surface and along the shoreline. As the season progresses, Lake Trout go deeper and finally reside beneath the thermocline. 

Most successful Lake Trout anglers use bright spinners or spoons while fishing from shore or near inlet and outlet streams. Trolling slowly through deep, colder water layers and along steep rock walls or dropoffs produces good catches of Lake Trout. Large spoons, often in combination with cut bait, are most effective when fishing through the winter ice. 

Natural mortality is low in most Lake Trout populations; however, slow growth, alternate year spawning, and older ages at maturity combine to make Lake Trout populations susceptible to overharvest by commercial and recreational fisheries. The practice of good conservation ethics will go a long way towards ensuring healthy trout populations for future anglers.', 'Lake Trout spawning takes place over clean, rocky lake bottoms from September through November. Males reach the spawning sites several days before the females and use their snouts and fins to clean the substrate. 

Spawning typically takes place at night with peak activity occurring after dusk, though there hav been a few documentations of daytime spawning. 

Eggs hatch early in the following spring. Little is known about the early life history of Lake Trout which are thought to be reclusive while feeding on plankton during their first few years of life. Spawning occurs for the first time after seven or eight years. 

Lake Trout spawn every other year or less frequently in northern territories, while in some southern populations may occur annually. 

Lake Trout growth varies from place to place depending on diet, water temperature, altitude, and genetics. Alaska Lake Trout can live longer than 40 years but more typical maximum ages are around 20 years.', 'Fish, crayfish, insect larvae, plankton', 'AK, CA, CO, ID, IL, IN, KY, MA, ME, MI, MN, NH, NJ, NY, PA, UT, VA, WA, WY ', 'Lake, River, Stream', '15-40', 'Lake Trout, also known scientifically as *Salvelinus namaycush*, are a prominent freshwater sport fish known for several key characteristics:

1. Impressive Size: Lake Trout are renowned for their large size, often reaching lengths over 3 feet and weighing more than 20 pounds, with some individuals growing even larger, especially in larger lakes and deep, cold waters.

2. Cold-Water Preference: They thrive in deep, cold, and clear freshwater lakes, particularly those in northern North America. They prefer habitats with well-oxygenated water and are often found at considerable depths.

3. Appearance: They have a distinctive look with silvery to dark bodies adorned with light spots. Their coloration often helps them blend into the rocky bottoms of the lakes they inhabit.

4. Longevity: Lake Trout are known for their longevity, with some individuals living over 20 years. Their long lifespan contributes to their potential to grow to large sizes.

5. Recreational Fishing: Highly prized by sport fishermen, Lake Trout provide a challenging catch due to their size and the deep waters they inhabit. Techniques such as trolling with lures and deep jigging are commonly used to catch them.

6. Culinary Value: They are also valued for their firm, rich-tasting flesh, making them a popular choice for eating, often smoked, grilled, or baked.

7. Ecological Role and Conservation: As top predators, Lake Trout play a vital role in their aquatic ecosystems by helping to regulate prey populations. In some areas, conservation efforts are crucial to maintain healthy populations, especially in the face of threats like habitat changes and competition with introduced species.

Lake Trout are a cherished species among anglers and play important ecological roles in the colder, deeper lakes of North America where they are typically found.', '24-36', '72 lb,

The former has a migratory instinct to swim to the sea, while the shasta strain is non migratory as it is typically landlocked.

Inland stocking programs have allowed both strains to mix, creating inland rainbows with the dominant migratory instinct. As a result, many rainbows initially stocked inland are eventually found in the sea.

The variety of Rainbows has resulted in a variety of colors, hues and markings. Normally the back is olive-green with a silvery cast on its sides fading to a silvery white belly.
